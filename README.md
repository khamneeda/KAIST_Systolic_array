Project in System for AI course
1. Design mytorch(mock version of pytorch) in C and CUDA
2. Design systolic array for 8*8 matrices multiplication in Verilog
3. Design systolic array for bigger matrices multiplication using tiling in Verilog

Project 1
1. Construct Yolo network using mytorch framework
2. Implement C and CUDA backend for mytorch
3. Apply CUDA optimization technique

Project 2

2. Design matrix multiplication system that satisfies OS(Output stationary) and WS(Weight stationary) design
3. Simulate it on FPGA considering timing delay in hardware

Project 3
Integrate FPGA into CPU system to implement end-to-end object detection algorithm
1. Quantize input activations and weights of conv, and dequantize output activations of conv
2. Tile matrix multiplication (Software-wise)
3. TIle matrix multiplication (Hardware-wise)
